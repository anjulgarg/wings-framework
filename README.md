# Wings Framework
##### A Simplistic, Fast & Flexible Micro Framework for Java Web Developers.

> **Note:** This repository contains the core code of the Wings framework. If you want to build an application using Wings Framework, clone the [Wings Sample App](https://github.com/anjulgarg/wings-sample-app).


Wings Framework was developed with a singular purpose in mind. 
To make Java more approachable as a server side language when compared 
to the scripting languages that rule the internet.

Wings Framework is naturally RESTful and makes API development a breeze. 
It can run on any server that supports Java 7, and was designed keeping portability in mind.

Wings Framework is very new and still in active development. However, the current version is production ready and 
the official documentation will help you get started easily.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for the framework can be found on the [Wings Website](http://wings.loonydev.com/docs).
